Portfolio Website

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

This is my first real attempt at making a portfolio site. It is pretty straight-forward for the most part, using mainly HTML and CSS. The only bit of JavaScript used in this site is used to create the "jello" effect on the page title on the left and the menu options on the right.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

The "about" and "contact info" pages were the simplest to code, as there were few elements that were involved. That being said, I feel as though they are the most successful not just because they came out as I wanted them, but also because their style is the simplest and most effective.

I feel as though I learned how to be even more organized than I already was prior to coding this site thanks to the high level of organization necessary for proper indentation, labeling, and line-skipping necessary with HTML and CSS files.

I resolved the mobile issue pretty well, removing the title tab on the left altogether. I did this because it took up a lot of unecessary space, since the webpage only has 4 pages and accessibility, since someone on mobile would navigate more quickly and be more aware of what page they were on than someone on computer.

I also learned how to adapt larger-scale projects even when very developed due to un foreseen issues. This was the case with a couple things I was incapable of doing due to lack of skill primarily, but also for user experience purposes.

    I originally had my portfolio scrolling horizontally to add a unique touch to my website's experience that would hopefully make it and my work more memorable. This was changed both for mobile and for computer formats for different reasons. For mobile, it would be difficult to scroll horizontally when there is only about half the screen from which to scroll. For computer, the page wouldn't scroll properly in Google Chrome unless it was done with a trackpad. I reverted to vertical scrolling to resolve this.

Despite being able to solve many bugs (literally so many) some still remain.

Many of these took place in the "resume" page. This was an imported HTML file from a previous project, along with one if its CSS files, that I repurposed and tried to have fit my new format.

After spending an entire day trying to get the old content to fit into the new frame, adjust to its style, and fixing various element-sizing bugs,there were some that I simply coulnd't solve.

    For one, the body dimensions for this page  are slightly smaller than other pages (noticeable if clicking between menu pages).
    
    Another issue I encountered was that the resume content would not be displayed as I intended it to in the original resume site.

Another pretty important issue I encountered was that my image files necessary for the actual "portfolio" section of my portfolio site wouldn't show up in either my coding program nor my online preview. This was the case with all my files (JPGs, PNGs,and PDFs alike) with the exception for the website's background SVG.

I ran into  more issues than just bugs too, beginning with my original vision being a bit too ambitious for my abilities. I wanted all sorts of different effects (like the background SVG wiggling in the when I would click on a menu link by means of JavaScript), but considering that a lot kept going wrong with the simpler, more beginner-friendly programs of HTML and CSS, I was unable to achieve such tasks.

Another issue I had that made the development of the site more difficult and frustrating than necessary were a mistake in which I threw away all my progress after a week of coding by duplicating my repository, editing one of the copies, and throwing out the most recent version (a hasty and habitual move on my part). This haste also cost me on another occasion, where I accidentally deleted all the files I intended to use in my portfolio section.

Another hurdle I encountered by my own accord was a personal break I used to spend time with a family member I had not seen for nearly 2 years. This action, although very necessary to myself as a person, was a terrible move for my coding, as I was unable to really keep up with the site for a week and prevented me from a couple classes' worth of feedback and delayed receiving help with issues I had.

Due to other personal obligations, I was also unable to properly reach out to receive the help I really needed with this project in the last month or so of its duration, which further complicated the website's proper completion.
