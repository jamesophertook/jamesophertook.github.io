                    <p>James is a Graphic Designer based out of Cape Cod, MA. Born a true Cape Codder but raised in Italy with plenty of additional traveling as a child, James has experienced very different cultures and is fluent in<br>both English and Italian.
                    <br><br>Reflecting his personality, his style is very professional yet friendly and inviting. He brings an interactive and well-thought-out process with just<br>the perfect amount of detail and color (or lack thereof) to every project<br>he takes on.
                    <br><br>Feel free to check out his resume and portfolio to learn more about him and what he is capable of.</p>
